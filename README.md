## Description

Credit Cards number validator.
The project is built in Typescript with ReactJS and Styled Components and it 
uses React-create-app with the typescript template.

It includes a very simple UI with an Input field for the card number, 
a more complete solution should include the CVV code, the expiration date and
the card holder.

The source is divided into modules: 

- a UI kit with the stateless graphic components
- a Utils module with the helper functions to validate the credit card
- a Features module with the CreditCardForm component that tie logic and UI together.
